# Tesco-Journey
Analysis of Tesco household data of over two years from a group of 2,500 households that are frequent shoppers at a retailer.

The data source is https://www.dunnhumby.com/sourcefiles,
which gives insight into:
a. Household level transactions over two years from a group of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at a retailer.
b. All of a householdâ€™s purchases within the store, not just those from a limited number of categories.
c. Demographics and direct marketing contact history for select households.

I have used this data to create a classifier to predicts if a user will buy a product the next time he / she shops with the retailer.
